# Inspiration
Learning blockchain technology was always on my undergrad wish list. However, I was more interested in full stack technologies. Recently, my friend Anush(anush443) inspired my interest in web3, and I am now learning the technology. I considered creating a practical application to better understand the technology. As a result, I created a Task Manager. It is the initial release of my first dApp.

# What it does?
It is a decentralised way to write and update yourÂ notes. You own the notes you write, and only you can view and change them. You can, however, assign them to other users on the same network. Once you've created them, you may add your own labels. The notes can be marked as finished and deleted once the goal has been met.

# How it is built?

The solution is developed on the Ethereum network with the Solidity programming language. React app is developed using Tailwind CSS to interface with the contracts placed on the network. For a better user experience, Google Icons and Fonts are utilised.

# Challenges
* Understand the Solidity language's data structures. 
* Connect the React App to the Contracts.

# Learnings
* Solidity Basics
* Web3JS
* Hardhat
